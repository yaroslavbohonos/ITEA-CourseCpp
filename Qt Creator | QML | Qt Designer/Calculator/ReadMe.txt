The programme was written in Qt Creator
Task: Create a real, interactive, five-function calculator with a graphical user interface. 
Of course, you can add as many additional functions as you like, but the basic operations (+, -, *, /, %) 
are mandatory. Moreover, we expect your calculator to be smart enough to handle division by zero without getting fooled.
